// Package providerstage describes the capabilities and workflow-input
// contracts of built-in provider-chain commands. Input lifecycle metadata is
// additive and retains retired names so validation can reject obsolete config
// before a stage runs; see inputs.go.
//
// # DSL-version linkage
//
// The manifest is the admission contract for every already-shipped config:
// each interpreter package compiles workflows against it, so an unversioned
// requirement edit used to land on every DSL version at once, with no
// deprecation window. That is the ed11ae81 incident class (TBH-1/#2386):
// narrowing backlog-dedupe's requirement broke every existing config in one
// commit, on every DSL version simultaneously. To keep that class impossible
// the table carries per-entry version linkage (dsl-3.0.md D7/§8, issue
// #3504): a Command and each of its CapabilityUse rows may declare the DSL
// version window in which they exist — sinceDSL inclusive, untilDSL
// exclusive, both empty meaning baseline (every version). Interpreters never
// read the table directly; each resolves the view for its own version via
// ForVersion, so a requirement change gated to a later DSL version is
// invisible to earlier interpreters: the old requirement keeps admitting
// old-version workflows while the new one applies only from the version that
// introduced it. A requirement swap at a version boundary is written as two
// rows — the old use closed with untilDSL, the new use opened with sinceDSL.
//
// Version windows fail closed: a bound that does not parse as a
// "<major>.<minor>" DSL version hides the gated element, and a view resolved
// for an unparseable version sees only baseline (unbounded) elements.
//
// Commands, Lookup, and ResultFile deliberately ignore the version linkage:
// they are the runtime/tooling surface (result-file defaults, CLI dispatch
// conformance, the builtincmd inventory parity), which must cover the union
// of every version's entries. Admission is the only version-gated consumer.

// runMergePR implements the `goobers merge-pr` built-in stage kind (issue
// #360): the provider-level conjunctive auto-merge action `merge-review`
// drives. It merges a PR only when EVERY independent conjunct holds —
// verdict=pass, CI green, not a draft, the SHA-pin (headSha/baseSha) still
// matches the PR's LIVE state, and — for a sibling-overlap PR — completed
// single-lander election evidence (#1071) — never a bare self-approval, and
// never trusting a caller-supplied "still valid" claim instead of re-polling
// (docs/design/v0/pr-lifecycle-loop.md §7/D6).
//
// A PR missing any one conjunct is a normal, expected outcome (the PR just
// isn't ready yet), not a stage failure: it exits 0 with merged=false and a
// human-readable reason in the declared result file, so a downstream gate
// can branch on Outputs["merged"] — the same philosophy as ci-poll, whose
// stage always succeeds at determining an outcome even when that outcome is
// "still pending" (internal/executor/cipoll.go's ciPollOutcome doc). Only a
// genuine provider/config error (missing capability, unresolvable repo, a
// merge attempt that should have succeeded but didn't) is a business error.

// must not be recorded as the reason this commit landed. A stale, absent, or
